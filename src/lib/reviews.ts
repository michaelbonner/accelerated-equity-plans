			'I’ve worked with Emily over several years in different capacities. I was thrilled to learn that Emily had started Accelerated Equity Plans.  AEP is my go-to for anything equity I need assistance with. Emily has assisted with process improvements, process documentation, as well as making herself available for random questions along the way.'
